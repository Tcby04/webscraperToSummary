Title: Resurfaced Video From 1998 Shows Alleged Bitcoin Creator Hal Finney Discussing Cryptographic Technology
A recently resurfaced video from 1998 has stirred up speculations regarding the alleged involvement of Hal Finney, an American software developer and early Bitcoin pioneer, in the creation of the flagship cryptocurrency.  The footage captures Finney discussing zero-knowledge proofs during the 18th annual International Cryptology Conference at the University of California, Santa Barbara. In the video, Finney explains his desire to prove knowledge of a message that hashes to a specific value without revealing any details about the message itself.  This concept, known as a zero-knowledge proof, was demonstrated by Finney using a program he had developed.  "I want to prove to you that I know a message that hashes to a given hash value using the SHA-1 hash. I don't want to reveal anything about the message to you. It's a zero-knowledge proof." He credits Ronald Cramer and Ivan Damgard as the inventors of the zero-knowledge proof system and praises its efficiency and flexibility. Zero-knowledge proofs are protocols that enhance the security and scalability of blockchain networks.  They play a significant role in rollups, a type of scaling solution that combines multiple transactions into a single transaction presented to the blockchain.  There are two main types of rollups: Optimistic and Zero Knowledge.  While Optimistic rollups assume the validity of all rolled transactions, allowing for subsequent validation and correction, Zero Knowledge rollups rely on zero-knowledge proof cryptography.  This cryptographic technique enables the mathematical verification of specific information without disclosing other sensitive details. Finney, born in California in 1956 and tragically passing away in 2014, was an influential figure in the early days of Bitcoin.  He gained attention in the crypto community when he claimed on Twitter in 2009 that he was "running Bitcoin," potentially making him the second person to use the software after Bitcoin's pseudonymous creator, Satoshi Nakamoto.  The following day, Finney received the first-ever Bitcoin transaction from Nakomoto, further fueling speculation about his involvement in the creation of the cryptocurrency.  Some members of the Bitcoin community believe that Finney may have been Satoshi Nakamoto himself or part of the group of developers behind the pseudonym. Interestingly, Finney's Twitter account resurfaced in late 2022 after a decade of inactivity.  His widow, Fran Finney, took over the account to prevent it from being purged by Elon Musk.  Notably, Finney's contributions to the world of cryptocurrency extend beyond Bitcoin. He also mentioned the concept of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) two decades before they gained widespread popularity, which further solidifies his reputation as a visionary in the field of digital assets. While some view Finney as Satoshi, there are no concrete evidence to support those claims.  Furthermore, Craig Wright, an Australian computer scientist, has long asserted that he is the pseudonymous Bitcoin creator.  However, a recent investigation has provided evidence to suggest that Nakamoto may actually be a collective entity.   One piece of evidence is the usage of both "we" and "I" in the Bitcoin white paper, indicating the possibility of a team operating under a singular pseudonym.    

Title: Crypto Platform Bybit to Suspend UK Operations Starting October 8  What's Going On?
Digital assets exchange Bybit, which cited early this month that new marketing rules in the UK would hinder its operations, will no longer accept new account applications from UK residents, starting October 1. The new rules, announced by the UK’s Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), apply to all crypto promotions including the ban on incentives like referral bonuses. The regulator said that the rules will come into effect from Oct. 8. To stay on the right side of FCA’s guidelines, crypto exchange Bybit will suspend its services in the UK market starting October 8. “Bybit has made a choice to embrace the regulation proactively,” the platform said in a press release. Existing UK users “will no longer be able to make any new deposits, create new contracts, or increase any of their existing positions for all products and services” from October 8, it added. Further, UK customers are encouraged to wind down their positions by January 8, 2024. Post the deadline, open positions will be liquidated, the company noted. FCA’s action to scrutinize crypto businesses to comply with its new marketing rule is “clear, fair and honest,” said Lucy Castledine, Director of Consumer Investments at FCA. “As a proportionate regulator, we’re giving firms that apply a little more time to get the other reforms requiring technology and business change right,” she said at the time. The move comes as regulators worldwide are concerned by the failure of global crypto businesses such as FTX and the tightening of rules denote increased regulatory oversight over crypto firms. Bybit confirmed that it would continue to grow in global markets and its “mission to deliver next level trading experiences to all crypto believers with the necessary guardrails in place.” Bybit’s exit from the UK market follows FCA’s “final warning” to crypto businesses about the upcoming financial promotions regime. The regulator said in a September 21 letter that all firms promoting cryptoassets to UK consumers must get ready for this regime. “This regime is important for reducing and preventing harm to consumers from investing in cryptoassets that do not match their risk appetite,” the watchdog wrote. “The regime will also create a fairer and more consumer-focused landscape in which firms can compete and innovate.” The letter further noted that due to the regulatory tightening, many overseas crypto asset firms refused to engage with the FCA and only 24 out of 150 firms responded to a survey sent by the regulator. “If unregistered cryptoasset firms continue to promote cryptoassets to UK consumers once the regime enters into force, they are likely to be in breach of section 21 of the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA). This would be a criminal offense punishable by up to 2 years imprisonment, an unlimited fine, or both.” The financial regulator also warned intermediaries such as social media platforms and search engines, app stores and payment firms to ensure unregistered crypto businesses do not promote illegal marketing to UK users.    

Title: High Gas Fees Alert: Binance Wallet Records $840,000 in Abnormal Ethereum Charges
The Ethereum (ETH) network experienced a surge of abnormally high gas fees on Thursday, with over 140,000 transactions directed to a wallet address labeled by Etherscan as “Binance 14.” While the Ethereum network's average gas fee hovered around 10 gwei, Binance’s transactions consistently paid fees exceeding 300 gwei, or around 30 times higher than what was needed. 300 gwei equals around $10. The extraordinary expenditure resulted in a temporary spike in gas fees on the Ethereum network, with users incurring substantial costs for sending transactions. Binance has confirmed in a media statement that the transactions were initiated by them, calling it a “routine consolidation of ETH.” “Any impact to gas prices was unintentional but quickly resolved,” a spokesperson for the exchange said. In total, the transactions drained more than 530 ETH, equivalent to approximately $840,000 in gas fees, briefly making it the largest gas user on the Ethereum network. Over the course of its lifetime, the wallet address is responsible for $95 million in transaction fees, including both inbound and outbound transactions. The incident was widely shared among community members on X, with one user saying it was a consolidation “from long-inactive deposit addresses.” Others also offered their take on the unusual transactions, with for instance Martin Köppelmann, co-founder of DeFi protocol Gnosis, suggesting that Binance is either using “a really inefficient script” or that “something fishy is going on.” Lastly, some community members blamed Binance’s wallet team for the glitch, calling the team’s engineers “incapable.” “They will release a case report soon. And likely someone got fired,” the user added.    

Title: Binance Sounds the Warning: EU's MiCA Law May Lead to Stablecoin Removals What's Going On?
Binance has raised concerns about the potential delisting of stablecoins in Europe due to the upcoming implementation of the European Union's Markets in Crypto Assets (MiCA) regulation.  “We are heading to a delisting of all stablecoins in Europe on June 30,” given that no project has yet been approved, Marina Parthuisot, head of legal at Binance France, told an online public hearing hosted by the European Banking Authority (EBA).  The comments come as the MiCA regulation, which is set to come into effect in the next few months, has left legal experts scrambling to decipher its implications. MiCA, finalized in June of last year, is poised to establish the EU as the first major jurisdiction to have comprehensive cryptocurrency regulations. It aims to allow exchanges and wallet providers to operate across the bloc with a single license, streamlining processes and bolstering oversight.  However, it is the provisions related to stablecoins that have garnered attention and caused concern within the industry. MiCA's regulations pertaining to stablecoins are scheduled to take effect in June 2024.  The EBA and the European Securities and Markets Authority (ESMA) are engaged in consultations to determine the finer details of these provisions. Binance CEO Changpeng "CZ" Zhao has responded to these concerns on social media, stating that the company has partners launching fully compliant stablecoins tied to the Euro (EUR) and other currencies.  Zhao claimed that Parthuisot's comments had been taken out of context and insinuated that they were part of a smear campaign. While Binance remains confident that a constructive solution will be reached before June 2024 to mitigate any adverse effects, the regulatory pressure brought on by MiCA has already prompted the exchange to withdraw from several European jurisdictions.  As reported, Binance announced back in June that it has decided to withdraw from the Dutch market following an unsuccessful attempt to obtain a virtual asset service provider (VASP) license from the Dutch regulator. The issue of decentralization has also surfaced, as many stablecoin issuers aim to operate in a completely decentralized manner, without a centralized point of decision-making or issuance.  This poses a challenge in meeting MiCA's stringent requirements. Despite the uncertainties, some believe that foreign issuers could potentially register through a crypto provider based within the EU, thereby avoiding fragmentation of major international initiatives like Circle's USDC stablecoin. However, regulatory authorities have not indicated a willingness to facilitate such arrangements. “There is no transitional arrangement for these types of [stablecoin] tokens. The rules will apply from the end of June next year,” Elisabeth Noble, team leader for MiCA at the EBA, told Parthuisot. In other news, some Binance customers in the EU have been blocked from withdrawing euros as part of an early change in the crypto exchange’s regional payments provider looms. Several users in the region have been denied access to Paysafe, Binance’s European payments partner, ahead of the September 25 deadline, when the payments company is set to end support for the exchange’s customers.        

Title: US SEC Seeks Public Comments on ARK & VanEck's Spot Ethereum ETFs
The US Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is reviewing applications for spot Ethereum exchange-traded funds (ETFs) from two asset managers – ARK Invest and VanEck. According to the agency’s release dated September 21, the SEC has sought public comments on the potential benefits and risks of approving these ETFs. The regulator has opened a 45-day public comment period for both filings. “The Commission is publishing this notice to solicit comments on the proposed rule change from interested persons.” On September 6, the Chicago Board Options Exchange (Cboe BZX Exchange) filed two 19b-4 applications to the United States securities regulator, requesting for the ARK 21 Shares and VanEck Ethereum ETF investment products to be listed on the exchange. While Ark 21Shares submitted S-1 filing on September 6, VanEck filed for the same in July 2021. The proposed ETFs will track the price of Ether using the CME CF Ether-Dollar Reference Rate and adjust for expenses and liabilities, the filings said. However, it is important to note that the review by the SEC does not guarantee acceptance of these ETFs. In fact, the first Ether futures ETF is slated to launch next month. The regulator has so far favored futures-based ETFs for Bitcoin (BTC) and Ether (ETH), citing that investor protections provided by the CME futures market cannot match with that of a spot ETF. Not long before, a Bloomberg ETF analyst James Seyffart noted that the spot Ether ETFs from ARK 21 Shares and VanEck “will ultimately start that clock.” “The Spot Ethereum ETF Race is officially on. It's early but I'd estimate a final deadline on these applications to be around ~May 23, 2024,” he said in a Tweet, early this month. Seyffart also predicted that more spot Ethereum ETF filings would come in the coming days. However, Ethereum ETFs come with their own obstacles such as regulatory approval. The regulator’s key concerns include investor protection, market manipulation, and underlying asset volatility. While there are unaddressed issues, spot Ethereum ETFs have the potential to increase acceptance, liquidity, and interest in the Ethereum ecosystem.    

Title: Sam Bankman-Fried's Father Faces Scrutiny Over Alleged Role in Democratic Dark Money Network
Joseph Bankman, the father of the embattled former crypto entrepreneur Sam Bankman-Fried, has reportedly been implicated in holding an advisory position within a prominent Democratic dark money network. Watchdogs suggest that this arrangement warrants a thorough investigation. This allegation surfaced after a lawsuit filed by FTX, Bankman-Fried's former company, against his parents. The suit, filed in federal court in Delaware, accuses Joe Bankman and Barbara Fried, both longstanding law professors at Stanford, of leveraging their connections within FTX to benefit financially, to the tune of millions of dollars. According to FTX's legal team, Mr. Bankman and Ms. Fried received a $10 million cash gift from their son, along with a $16.4 million home in the Bahamas, where FTX was headquartered and was purchased by the exchange. The lawsuit also contends that Mr. Bankman played a role in concealing complaints from a former lawyer of his son's business and that Ms. Fried provided guidance to Mr. Bankman-Fried and another FTX executive on evading disclosure requirements for political donations. The lawsuit asserts that the couple "either knew — or ignored bright red flags revealing — that their son, Bankman-Fried, and other FTX insiders were orchestrating a vast fraudulent scheme." Recent allegations have surfaced regarding Joseph Bankman,that claimed that he held an advisory role at Arabella Advisors, a consulting firm in Washington, D.C., overseeing a nonprofit network that supports left-leaning groups. This network manages significant funds, including the New Venture Fund, Sixteen Thirty Fund, Windward Fund, and Hopewell Fund, collectively handling over a billion dollars in anonymous donations each year, which are then distributed to liberal causes and initiatives nationwide. Caitlin Sutherland, the executive director of Americans for Public Trust, stressed the importance of thoroughly examining this arrangement, especially in understanding the extent to which Sam Bankman-Fried may have used his political influence through this influential liberal dark money network. "This arrangement deserves serious scrutiny, especially the extent to which SBF tried to leverage his political influence through the most powerful liberal dark money network in America." However, Arabella Advisors spokesperson Steve Sampson vehemently denied any involvement by Bankman in the firm. He noted that FTX had previously wired $8 million to the Arabella-managed New Venture Fund, and it appears that the FTX attorneys handling the lawsuit against Joseph Bankman and Barbara Fried, his wife, mistakenly suggested that he held an advisory position at Arabella Advisors. A spokesperson for the New Venture Fund clarified that they had collaborated with the FTX Foundation to provide administrative services for certain grantmaking activities. Joseph Bankman's role was linked to a project affiliated with the company but operating independently. The fund's spokesperson said: "In early 2022, NVF issued grants from a project advised by Mr. Bankman and affiliated with the FTX Foundation, all of which went to vet charitable organizations addressing environmental challenges and hunger carefully."  Given the allegations in the lawsuit against Sam Bankman-Fried's parents, which suggest they profited significantly from their son's financially troubled cryptocurrency venture and potentially channeled undisclosed funds to liberal causes via Arabella, some argue that both of them, being law professors at Stanford University, could face charges related to conspiracy, banking, and election law violations. However, it remains to be seen whether these claims hold substantial evidence or are merely unsupported accusations at this point.    

Title: Bitmain to Invest $54 Million in Bankrupt Bitcoin Mining Company Core Scientific
Digital asset miner Core Scientific announced a new partnership with Bitmain, a major player in the supply of Bitcoin mining and Artificial Intelligence (AI) computing hardware.  As part of the deal, Bitmain will invest $53.9 million in the company expanding their long-standing relationship. Per the agreement, Bitmain will supply the crypto miners 27,000 Bitmain S19J XP 151 TH mining servers for $23.1 million and an investment of $53.9 million in Core Scientific stock, the value of which is decided by the bankruptcy court in Q4 2023. As it emerges from a bankruptcy proceeding, Core Scientific would reshape its operations leveraging on the cash/equity deal and previous hosting agreements with Bitmain to support the latter’s mining operations. This development could see the mining industry in North America deepen further with top-notch equipment and a clear roadmap for expansion.  Since it commenced mining operations in 2017, Cire has deployed over 600,000 Bitmain miners with about 99% of the company’s hosting customers being Bitmain S19 models. Both companies announced the deal as beneficial to their course over the next few years at a time when the crypto mining sector is taking hits from regulators and biting market forces. Max Hua, Bitmain’s CEO speaking on the deal stressed their long-standing relationship with Core and a good track record over the years. “We look forward to deepening our strategic relationship with Core Scientific, our long-standing U.S.-based partner. Their professionalism, integrity, and commitment to the success of their hosting customers and the growth of the Bitcoin (BTC) Network is unsurpassed in the industry.” Hua added Core Scientific is essential to the Bitcoin network and needed to establish the blockchain’s full potential. For Core, CEO Adam Sullivan sees it as a platform for expanding their fleet as they prepare for the next halving. “We are honored to expand our significant relationship with Bitmain. Together, we have worked tirelessly to professionalize our industry, charting a path for the long-term growth of the Bitcoin Network as Bitcoin adoption increases around the world.” Last week Celsius and Core Scientific reached a tentative $45 million agreement that will see Celsius pay $14 million in cash with the remainder in adjusted claims for the Cedarvale mining site. Keen on performance, the company aims to maximize existing machines and restructure its operations to maintain its stance as a main global player.  “We are seeking ways to optimize performance and efficiency at both the data center and individual miner level. We are repositioning some of our machines between and inside of our facilities to increase post-halving profitability,” Sullivan noted.     

Title: South Koreans Busan to Launch Digital Assets Trading Platform This Year
The South Korean city of Busan says it will launch a long-awaited blockchain-powered digital assets trading platform before the year is over. Per Meil Kyungjae, Busan city officials told reporters this week that they want to create a “fourth-generation blockchain-powered exchange” that “can tokenize valuable assets such as raw materials and precious metals.” Busan Mayor Park Hyeong-jun and other officials said the exchange will be established “entirely” using private capital. Park said a public offering would launch in mid-October, with a business operator selected in November. City officials said the Busan-based exchange would “use blockchain technology to tokenize and sell valuable assets such as raw materials, precious metals, carbon and emissions certificates, and intellectual property rights.” The city has been vocal about its intentions to launch a platform it has called the Busan Digital Asset Exchange (BDX) for well over a year. The city has stated that the exchange will become a “global integrated platform for digital assets.” Last year, the city partnered with a number of major crypto exchanges such as Binance, as well as Crypto.com and Gate.io, in a bid to fast-track its project. The city has spoken about its desire to launch the exchange before the end of 2023. But confusion has surrounded the type of tokens the platform will be able to list. In the past, city officials have spoken of the platform’s ability to “list and trade virtual currencies.” In Korean, the term “virtual currencies” is usually used to refer to coins such as Bitcoin and Ethereum, rather than digitized commodities and securities. But in its most recent announcements on the matter, Busan has veered away from using terms like “virtual currency,” and instead favored expressions like “digital assets.” As controversy about coin manipulation allegations, the Terra ecosystem collapse, and the political scandal known as Coin Gate continue, South Korean government organs have played down the role of crypto in the economy. This runs contrary to President Yoon Suk-yeol’s election manifesto, which played up the role of the crypto sector. Instead, it harks back to his predecessor’s policy – that of separating the blockchain and crypto sectors. Even security token offerings (STOs) appear to be off the table for the moment in Busan, despite the fact that South Korean players had hoped to release STO-related offerings this year. Banks had hoped to fast-track STO platforms, but the government has recently tempered its crypto-related policies, perhaps in response to the aforementioned controversies. Park said, “The government has not yet issued clear regulations for STOs [...] so I think that area will be something we focus on in the future.”    

Title: Walmart's Entry into Roblox Metaverse Guides Kids to 'Discover the Top Toys'
US retailer Walmart has joined the ranks of corporates seeking to capitalize on the popularity of metaverse platforms like Roblox, but the strategy is being criticized for being aimed at children. According to crypto news outlet The Block, the two Walmart divisions Walmart Land and Walmart’s Universe of Play will launch several new game-like experiences for Roblox, including some where players can join a fashion show and a Jurassic Park-themed game for collecting eggs. In the games, players can earn certain in-game tokens, prizes and so-called “verch,” short for virtual merchandise. Walmart has since at least early 2022 been expected to move deeper into the metaverse, after a flurry of patent filings from the company revealed a willingness to embrace crypto, NFTs and the metaverse. While Walmart has not officially commented on its embrace of Roblox, William White, chief marketing officer at Walmart US, was quoted by the Block as saying they chose Roblex because "customers are spending loads of time there." Both Roblox and Walmart’s use of the popular metaverse platform has received some criticism, given that almost 25% of the platform’s daily active users are children under the age of 13. Additionally, Walmart also appears to target children specifically with player messages like “making a toy wish list has never been this fun! Find them all at Walmart.” According to The Block, a complaint was filed in April with the Federal Trade Commission by the American non-profit Truth in Advertising saying Roblox had “completely shirked its responsibility” with regards to advertising rules.    

Title: Chinese Banks, Firms Make Digital Yuan Smart Contract Progress
Chinese banks and businesses want to step up their use of digital yuan-powered smart contracts, as the financial and industrial sectors eye CBDC progress. Per the Securities Times (via Stockstar), the state-run Postal Savings Bank of China has “officially” co-launched the nation’s first “prepayment product” to make use of digital yuan smart contracts. Unlike many other CBDC projects, the e-CNY is not blockchain-based. Rather than making use of decentralized ledger technology, it utilizes centralized IT solutions. These solutions are all controlled by the central People’s Bank of China (PBoC). But the PBoC has been keen to cherry-pick IT advances from the world of Bitcoin, crypto, and blockchain, with a view to integrating these in the e-CNY project. One of these is smart contract technology. Chinese economic thinkers believe this will help in business areas like financing and local government spending. The Postal Savings Bank’s platform has been created in conjunction with China Fangyuan, a heavy machinery, transport, and construction-focused business group. The parties have called their new platform Wuka, and say it can provide merchants with a range of “business capabilities,” including card issuance, project supervision, marketing, and management. The media outlet noted that the new platform “introduces digital yuan smart contracts into the merchant business field.” It added that the move would also “promote the use of the digital RMB” in the “prepayment space.” Prepayment deals are common in industries where vendors provide custom- or tailor-made products or services. Banks worldwide are growing increasingly keen on using smart contract technology. But in China, state-run entities have attempted to integrate this with the digital yuan project. In a column published in the financial newspaper Caixin, the Digital Currency Department of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China ( ICBC), wrote: “In the future, all contracts based on [...] payments in the digital economy will be [compatible] with digital [yuan-powered] financial services.” The ICBC wrote that digital yuan smart contracts would be particularly valuable “in situations where trust is weak and where breaches of contract occur frequently.” The bank noted that e-CNY smart contracts will “effectively ensure the enforcement and automatic honoring of contracts.” Using the CBDC in smart contracts makes sense, the ICBC claimed, because “credit rating is upgraded from the commercial credit of a commercial entity to the national creditworthiness of the PBoC.” The use of the coin will thus “enable mutual recognition and interoperability across business sectors,” the ICBC concluded. On the retail front, the PBoC is hoping to attract international attention for its coin at the 19th Asian Games. The games got underway on September 21 in Hangzhou. Spectators, athletes, and coaches will be shown how to use the coin at “experience booths” run by the likes of the ICBC at and around games venues. Domestic spectators, meanwhile, have been encouraged to use the coin to buy tickets and pay for public transport rides to event venues.
